correct solution depends on WHAT you are initializing.

Examples:

Load cache from DB

Warm up Redis

Call another service

Validate configuration

Create background tasks

Run one-time migration logic

Schedule periodic jobs

Option 4: ApplicationReadyEvent ⭐ (PRODUCTION-GRADE)
@Component
public class StartupListener {

    @EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class)
    public void onApplicationReady() {
        // initialization logic
    }
}

Why this is excellent

✔ App is fully started
✔ Embedded server is up
✔ All beans are ready
✔ Profiles & configs resolved

This is my recommended default

Use this when:

You call external services

You load cache

You warm up systems

You want “after everything is ready”
