Next logical practice steps (I recommend this order)

Add DLQ consumer

Add retry topic (instead of same topic retry)

Pause/resume listener

Exactly-once semantics discussion

Kafka Streams (only basics)

Implement JSON event

One powerful mental model (remember this)
------------------------------------------------
application.yaml = defaults
Java config = specialization

Once you get this, Kafka becomes simple.
