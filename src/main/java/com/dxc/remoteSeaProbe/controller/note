In my current project, most update APIs are implemented using POST for simplicity and legacy reasons.
However, I understand that PUT is meant for full resource replacement and PATCH for partial updates,
and I’ve designed PATCH-based APIs in POCs and personal projects.

Why PUT / PATCH are missing in your project (REAL reasons)
1️⃣ POST is abused for everything (most common)

In many projects you’ll see:

POST /updateUser
POST /modifyProbe
POST /saveOrUpdate

Why teams do this:

POST “just works”
No strict semantics
Easier to evolve
Less discussion in reviews
Most enterprise codebases:

POST = do something
PUT/PATCH require discipline. Many teams don’t bother.

Correct way to configure CORS with Spring Security (BEST PRACTICE)
✅ Preferred modern setup
@Bean
SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .cors(Customizer.withDefaults())
        .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
        );
    return http.build();

    And:

    @Bean
    CorsConfigurationSource corsConfigurationSource() {
        CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration();
        config.setAllowedOrigins(List.of("https://frontend.com"));
        config.setAllowedMethods(List.of("GET","POST","PUT","DELETE","OPTIONS"));
        config.setAllowedHeaders(List.of("*"));
        config.setAllowCredentials(true);

        UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source =
                new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
        source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", config);
        return source;
    }

    Spring Security automatically registers CorsFilter BEFORE its chain.
